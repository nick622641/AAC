        "description": "Artist David Brooks is a fan of Japanese artist Isao Tomita and his unique synthesized music. It's no surprise therefore that David took inspiration from Tomita's album covers when he painted Automata. For those unfamiliar with his work, Tomita is considered by many to be the grandfather of electronic music and space-music. Broadly, Automata refers to machines making tasks easier, more efficient and less mistake-prone and ultimately helping humans toward an easier if not brighter future. In David's representation, horizontal bands overlay the image of what could be a face. A stark canvas texture and an alluring vignette create a puzzling and mysterious image. This gorgeous abstract would compliment any well lit room.",
